# Data Turtle Mobile App

A Flutter project that lets users conveniently access MongoDB database managed by an API [from here](https://github.com/cocacola-lover/myAppMongoAPI).

## This is just a small test project with a lot of problems
 but I'm still proud of it.

To use this app you have to create your own strings.dart file. Also due to major miscalculation on my part app stops working and needs to be restarted every time phone loses internet connection. I spend a lot of time on this problem, but I had to eventually give up and deal with it so I wouldn't have to spend another month on this project.
